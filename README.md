# OpenTrials Public and Private Registries

This is [data package](http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/) with
information on public and private registries of clinical trials.  It
intended to be used to track sources of trial data for the
[OpenTrials](http://opentrials.net) platform.

The majority of this information comes from the
[WHO ICTRP](http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/)
(International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and the websites of
the individual registries.
